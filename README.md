# jQuery Clearable Input Plugin

The jQuery Clearable Input Plugin is a lightweight and customizable solution that enhances the user experience by adding a convenient clear button to input fields. This plugin is particularly useful when dealing with grouped input fields, such as those representing customer details like name, ID, and address. With a single click, users can clear the main input field and optionally define additional inputs to be cleared simultaneously.
